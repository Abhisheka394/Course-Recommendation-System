# Course-Recommendation-System
Searching for a course online is difficult as to where to select and which course
to select and when you eventually select, first of all, it takes a lot of time and you
even don’t know is it a correct course?
This project helps students to find courses based on the keywords given. The
project works on the technology domain of data analytics. The algorithm used is
Cosine similarity and vectorization of data. The system calculates the score and
on the decreasing order of score, the system displays the list. We can increase or
decrease the no of courses recommended by the system.
There are two types of users, one who is registered and the other who is not
registered. For the nonregistered user, it will recommend the best website across
all websites but for registered users, there will be an add-on facility that will
recommend the course as per users’ search and purchase history.
